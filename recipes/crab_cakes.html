    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> This Crab Cake recipe is the true Crab Cake with no fillers and no heavy spices, all crab meat. This recipe has been in my family for generations. </p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup water </li>
      <li> 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix </li>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white sugar </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li>
      <li>8 taco shells, warmed </li>

    </ul>

    <h4> Steps </h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well. </li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
      <li> Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li> Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li>
    </ol>
